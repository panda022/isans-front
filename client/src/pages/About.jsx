            ISANS is a non-profit organization that provides settlement and 
            integration services to immigrants who are in or are destined 
            for communities across Nova Scotia. By offering comprehensive programs and supports, as well as a dedicated and caring team, we help immigrants build a promising future here.
            </p>

            <p>
            As the front door to many of Nova Scotiaâ€™s immigrants, our goal is to create a community where all can belong and grow, in turn building a stronger Nova Scotia and Canada for all.
